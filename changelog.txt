2.0 (January 09, 2026)
Zer0morph's original flags remain unchanged, but this new version features new mod support (see section in forum thread) and a new design philosophy that favours changing the black background to dark grey to avoid altering the colour patterns completely.


W.I.P :
- PAGMS : correcting incorrect path for sfc_player and removed unused flags
- RFC : permission to add 3 flags : rfc_mechab_flag.png (version prior to 1.2.0), rfc_baryon_flag.png (version prior to 1.2.0), rfc_owl_flag.png
- Added support for Buns - flag pack
- Minor shadow/highlights adjustments on various flags
- Waiting for permission for certains mods, mainly under no derivative licenses
